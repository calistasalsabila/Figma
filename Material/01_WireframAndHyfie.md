# Wireframing & Fidelity in Figma

## 🎨 What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is a visual guide that represents the structure of a digital product, such as a website or mobile app. It focuses on layout, user flow, and functionality rather than visual design.

### 📌 Why Use Wireframes?
- Helps plan the layout and structure before adding design elements
- Saves time by identifying usability issues early
- Facilitates collaboration between designers, developers, and stakeholders

## 🔍 Types of Fidelity in Wireframing
Fidelity refers to the level of detail and realism in a wireframe. There are three main levels:

### 1️⃣ **Low-Fidelity (Lo-Fi) Wireframes**
- Simple, sketch-like structures
- Focuses on basic layout and content placement
- No colors, images, or interactive elements
- Usually made with hand-drawn sketches or simple digital tools (e.g., Figma, Balsamiq)

**Example:** Basic black-and-white layout with rectangles and placeholder text.

### 2️⃣ **Mid-Fidelity (Mid-Fi) Wireframes**
- More refined layout with basic typography and grayscale elements
- No real images, but placeholders may be used
- Gives a clearer idea of spacing and proportions
- Created using design tools like Figma or Adobe XD

**Example:** Grayscale wireframe with labeled buttons and text sections.

### 3️⃣ **High-Fidelity (Hi-Fi) Wireframes**
- Closest representation of the final product
- Includes colors, typography, icons, and real images
- May have interactive elements (clickable prototypes)
- Used for user testing and final approvals

**Example:** A fully designed Figma prototype that looks like a finished app.

## 🆚 Wireframing vs. Prototyping
| Feature | Wireframing | Prototyping |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Purpose | Structure & layout planning | Interactive user experience |
| Fidelity | Low to High | High |
| Interaction | No or minimal | Clickable elements |
| Tools | Figma, Balsamiq, Sketch | Figma, Adobe XD, InVision |

## 🎯 Best Practices for Wireframing
✅ Start with Lo-Fi wireframes before adding details  
✅ Keep it simple – focus on usability, not design  
✅ Use grayscale to emphasize layout over visuals  
✅ Gather feedback and iterate before moving to Hi-Fi wireframes  
✅ Align wireframes with user needs and business goals
